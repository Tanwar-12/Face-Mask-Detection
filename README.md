# FACE MASK DETECTIONFaceüò∑ {An Amazing Project}

### Overview : 
The purpose of this project is to create a Deep Learning model that identifies whether or not someone is wearing a mask. My model is based on YOLO's object detection algorithm, and I'm using the dataset from Roboflow website.

### Dataset : 
 https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/mask-wearing

**The dataset consists of two classes :**
- with_mask
- without_mask

  # Data Preparation:
  * Create a bounding boxes with the help of label-img And makesense.ai website according to YoloV5.
  * Prepare folder structure that can be accept by YoloV5.

## Steps to use Yolov5:
* Cloning the YoloV5 file from official repository.
* Changing the directory of yolov5
* Installing the dependencies
* Download all versions pre-trained weights.

 ## Steps Before Training Custom Dataset:
* Go to yolov5/data/.
* Open coco128.yaml
* Edit the following inside it:

 1. Training and Validation file path
 2. Number of classes and Class names.

  ## Training YOLOV5 Model
* Set images size 640 with batch of 8.
* Train model around 600 epochs .
* Visualise the training metrics with the help of tensorboard.

## Testing Video Demo:
Face mask detection is an object detection task that detects whether people are wearing masks or not in videos. This repo includes a demo for building a face mask detector using YOLOv5 model.
